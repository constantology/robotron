# Robotron

## requirements

- node v0.11.x — this is using the koa library which uses harmony generators, hence the most current version of node is needed to run the server
- npm 2.x
- redis-server

## install dependencies

`npm install`

## start server

`npm start`

## run tests

`npm test`

**note:** I didn't go crazy with unit tests as I didn't want to spend all day on this and you can see any of my github projects unit tests to see how I write tests.

## notes

to view available API versions: `http://localhost:3001/api`

to view available API endpoints for the stable API version: `http://localhost:3001/api/stable`

again, i didn't go crazy trying to comment the test, I would prefer to either walk you through my test answer or — prefereably — the current project I'm working on.
